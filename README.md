# Bioinformatics

Repository with some useful python scripts at the service of Bioinformatics, from global alignment to fasta/fastq, SAM, VCF and GTF file handling.

This material was developed in order to take the "Bioinformatics" exam at Polythecnic of Turin (yy 2020-2021).

### Remember:
Unzip the GTF for letting mains.py to work where needed.
